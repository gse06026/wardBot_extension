# Privacy Policy for Ward Bot

**Last Updated:** October 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Ward Bot ("we", "us", or "our") handles your personal information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Data Collection

Ward Bot does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers. We respect your privacy and have designed our extension with privacy-first principles.

The extension does access the following information locally within your browser:

1. **Web Page Content:** When you use the "Find Answers" feature, the extension reads text content from the current webpage you're browsing to provide context to the Chrome AI for analysis. This content stays within your browser and is not sent to any external server.

2. **User Input:** The extension processes text you enter in the popup interface (questions or notes) to provide AI-generated responses. This input is processed locally using Chrome's built-in AI capabilities.

3. **Selected Text:** When using the right-click context menu feature, the extension accesses the text you have selected to explain it using analogies.

4. **User Preferences:** We store your personal interest preferences in Chrome's `sync.storage` to customize the analogy tutor feature. This information helps us create explanations based on your hobbies or interests.

## Data Usage

All data processing occurs locally on your device using Chrome's built-in AI capabilities. Your data is not transmitted to any external servers or third-party services.

- Web page content is temporarily accessed to answer your questions and provide relevant highlights
- Your personal interests are used to generate customized analogies that relate to your hobbies
- Highlights are applied only to the current webpage DOM and disappear when you navigate away
- Study notes exist only in the popup interface memory and are not persistently stored

## Data Storage and Duration

- Page content and user input are processed temporarily and not persistently stored
- User preferences (interests) are stored using Chrome's `sync.storage` and remain available until you change them
- Highlighted text is applied only to the current webpage DOM and does not persist when you navigate away
- Study notes exist only in the popup interface memory and are not persistently stored
- The `textToAdd` value is temporarily stored in Chrome's `local.storage` only when transferring highlighted text to the note pad, and is immediately deleted after use

## Third-Party Sharing

Ward Bot does not share any personal information with third parties. All processing happens locally within your browser environment.

## User Rights

As a user of our extension, you have the following rights:

1. **Access:** You can view all stored data by examining the local storage in your browser's developer tools
2. **Modification:** You can change your preferences through the extension's options page
3. **Deletion:** You can delete all stored data by removing the extension from Chrome or clearing your browser's local storage for the extension

To remove all extension data:

1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Find Ward Bot and click "Remove"
3. Or clear browsing data for the extension specifically

## Security

We implement security measures to protect your data within the browser environment:

- All data processing occurs locally without external transmission

- User inputs are validated to prevent potential security issues
